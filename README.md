# Graph-Convolutional-Gaussian-Processes-on-Link-Prediction
A project about GCGP (Graph Convolutional Gaussian Processes) in LP (Link Prediction)  
Please Note that ***this project is ongoing, the performance of my code is not perfect.***  
## Update  
**[2022-10-08]** Code has been released. The code is just a prototype, which uses **NO** inducing method to construct both node-wise and edge-wise Gaussian processes. The performance in two datasets:***Texas, Wisconsin*** are just so-so. I will continue to think about it.
